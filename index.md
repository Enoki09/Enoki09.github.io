### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1, has to be my favorite, for it was the start of my coding journey and taught me the basics. It was where I learned how to use the terminal, git clone, commit changes, and push your changes to Git Hub. But also Declaring integer variables, std::cout, and writing an expression that C++ will understand. Looking back, it didn't seem so difficult, but it was hard to know for me when I first started.
* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1, has to be my second favorite because learning and coding a new game called Mad Libs was fun. It was about filling the blanks for a sentence about the sandwich, following a pattern that reads the sandwich's ingredients. We also learned within this lab to use the arguments vector and three arguments after the command name.
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1, was my third favorite because I learned to write a function that can compute averages, which could be helpful in my future projects. Within Lab 9, we had to take the judge scores, validate the scores, convert the string to float points, then use double to compute the average and output the message. Overall, the lab was fun, even with the error that my partner was able to correct. Make use of the arguments vector and three arguments after the command name.
