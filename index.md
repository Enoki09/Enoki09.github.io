### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1, was my first favorite because I learned to write a function that can compute averages, which could be helpful in my future projects. Within Lab 9, we had to take the judge scores, validate the scores, convert the string to float points, then use double to compute the average and output the message. Overall, the lab was fun, even with the error that my partner was able to correct. 
    
* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1, has to be my second favorite because I'd learned a new game called Mad Libs and coded it as It was about programming a code that would fill the blanks for a sentence about the sandwich, which would follow a pattern that reads the ingredients of a sandwich.
* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1, has to be my top favorite because, looking back, it was much more straightforward and was where my coding journey started. It was where you learned how to use the terminal, git clone, commit changes, and push your changes to Git Hub. When looking back, it didn't seem so difficult, but it was hard when starting and knowing about code.
